# CRED Expandable View

This contains a CREDExpandableView framework which is used to demonstrate expandable and collapsable Stack Views in iOS.

The repo also contains a project called CREDExpandableViewExample which demonstrates the use of the above framework.

PS - The color combination in the Example app is horrible, please ignore that. My aim was just to demonstrate how you could expand and collapse a Stack View from, which is exported from a framework with a few basic customisations.
